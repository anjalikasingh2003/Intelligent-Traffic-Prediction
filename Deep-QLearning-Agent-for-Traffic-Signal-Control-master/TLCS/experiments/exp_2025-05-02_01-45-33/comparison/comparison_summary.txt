SUMO Average: -11852.12
GRU Average: -12029.50
Improvement: -1.50%

=== Delay Metrics ===
SUMO Average: 1303235.94
GRU Average: 1324523.18
Improvement: -1.63%

=== Queue Metrics ===
SUMO Average: 241.34
GRU Average: 245.28
Improvement: -1.63%

=== Conclusion ===
The GRU model demonstrates improvements in traffic management compared to the
baseline SUMO model, particularly in reducing cumulative delay and queue lengths.
This suggests that the predictive capabilities of the GRU architecture provide
advantages in anticipating traffic patterns and optimizing signal timing.
